# ngX Starter Kit

Web project starter kit including modern tools and workflow based on
[angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), best practices from the community, a scalable base template and
a good learning base.

### Benefits

- Quickstart a project in seconds and focus on features, not on frameworks or tools

- Industrial-grade tools, ready for usage in a continuous integration environment and DevOps

- Scalable architecture with base app template including example components, services and tests

> Note: This project is still under development, see the [current status](#current-status) section for more information.

# Getting started

1. Install required tools:
 ```bash
 npm install -g @angular/cli
 ```

2. Go to project folder then install dependencies:
 ```bash
 npm install
 ```
 
3. Launch development server, and open `localhost:4200` in your browser:
 ```bash
 npm start
 ```

# Main tasks

Task automation is based on [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).

Tasks                         | Description
------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
npm start                     | Run development server on `http://localhost:4200/`
npm run build [-- --env=prod] | Lint code and build app for production in `dist/` folder
npm test                      | Run unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) in watch mode
npm run test:ci               | Lint code and run unit tests once for continuous integration
npm run e2e                   | Run e2e tests using [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org)
npm run lint                  | Lint code
npm run translations:extract  | Extract strings from code and templates to `src/app/translations/template.json`
npm run docs                  | Display project documentation

When building the application, you can specify the target environment using the additional flag `--env <name>` (do not
forget to prepend `--` to pass arguments to npm scripts).

The default build environment is `prod`.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.
You should not use `ng serve` directly, as it does not use the backend proxy configuration by default.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use
`ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Additional tools

Tasks are mostly based on the `angular-cli` tool. Use `ng help` to get more help or go check out the
[Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

# Current status

## What's in the box

The app template is based on [HTML5](http://whatwg.org/html), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com). The translation files use the common
[JSON](http://www.json.org) format.

#### Tools

Development, build and quality processes are based on [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and
[NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), which includes:

- Optimized build and bundling process with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
- [Development server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) with backend proxy and live reload
- Cross-browser CSS with [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and
  [browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist)
- Asset revisioning for [better cache management](https://webpack.github.io/docs/long-term-caching.html)
- Unit tests using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)
- End-to-end tests using [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor)
- Static code analysis: [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint), [Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer),
  [Stylelint](http://stylelint.io) and [HTMLHint](http://htmlhint.com/)
- Local knowledgebase server using [hads](https://github.com/sinedied/hads)

#### Libraries

- [Angular 2](https://angular.io)
- [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com)
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io)

- [TypeScript](docs/coding-guides/typescript.md)
- [Sass](docs/coding-guides/sass.md)
- [HTML](docs/coding-guides/html.md)

- [Updating dependencies and tools](docs/updating.md)
- [Using a backend proxy for development](docs/backend-proxy.md)

## Work in progress

These features are currently WIP and not implemented in this version:

- Http service extension to provide support for server configuration, default headers and user-configurable cache
  policy.
- Window service wrapper into Angular DI system (to allow mocking in unit tests)

## Limitations

- `translations:extract` cannot extract translated strings from variables
  ([#10](https://github.com/biesbjerg/ng2-translate-extract/issues/10))
- No HTML minification (due to `angular-cli` lack of add-on support for build process)
- No images assets optimization (due to `angular-cli` lack of add-on support for build process)
