# Introduction to Ionic

[Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) is an UI framework initially made to create mobile hybrid applications by providing
Angular components rendering with a native look on each platform.

In their latest version built with Web Components rewrite, they officially support web apps in addition to mobile
and desktop hybrid apps providing iOS and Android (Material design) looks for the components.

### Why not using Ionic CLI?

Since Ionic v4 move to embrace Web Components and native build tools for each framework,
[Ionic CLI](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli) now uses Angular CLI under the hood to perform all build-related
task, so we can completely skip it and have one less dependency in our package :wink:.
